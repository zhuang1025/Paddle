The results were considered statistically significant at *p*-value \< 0.05 unless
otherwise specified in the figures. *p*-value between two independent groups

Helminth parasites have a particularly subdivided population structure as adult
worms are confined within their definitive host, and only able to mate with
other worms that belong to the same infrapopulation.
If the resistance allele is recessive and it has a low initial frequency, inbreeding
will increase parasite homozygosity and as a result, the spread of drug resistant
worms

Parasite inbreeding increases the range of underlying adult worm allele *Y*
