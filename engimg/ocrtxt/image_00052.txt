Melinda: *softening.* Hagar, sometimes I think you're the only light in this

If an allele conferring drug resistance is recessive, excess parasite
homozygosity will increase the probability that a resistance allele will survive
treatment.

Parasite overdispersion reduces the number of hosts whoare
microfilaria-positive and concentrates allele *Y* into a small proportion of the
host population.

Kevin: wow that sounds awesome. but yeah i've got a lot of good memories
about sledding as well! it was always something special! *i nod and then we
keep walking.
If the resistance allele is recessive and it has a low initial frequency, inbreeding
will increase parasite homozygosity and as a result, the spread of drug resistant
