Further down the 2022 World Cup odds, Belgium sits at +1100, followed by Argentina at +1200, and Italy at +1800, while England joins the Netherlands at +2000.
Kevin: yeah those mugs are quite funny. i bet there are stores where you can customize them xD what would be a funny joke to be printed on such a mug for my dad?
Simplify ((j*j**(-2))/j)**(-2/61)/((j*j/j**1)/j*j)**(-35) assuming j is positive.
If an allele conferring drug resistance is recessive, excess parasite homozygosity will increase the probability that a resistance allele will survive treatment.
Don’t even care about the yarny goodness, stoked to see that you are back in the world of the living! Hospitals are wonderful for saving lives, but home is where you heal...
