The electrons in electric-discharge CO.sub.2 lasers cause dissociation of some CO.sub.2 into O.sub.2 and CO and attach themselves to electronegative molecules such as O.sub.2, forming negative O.sub.2.sup.- ions, as well as larger negative ion clusters by collisions with CO or other molecules.

Combining these three procedures gives a density estimation algorithm with the claimed guarantees.
4. The function has a docstring enclosed in triple quotes (`&quot;&quot;&quot;`) that provides a brief description of what the function does.
Zoe: hmmph! whatever do you mean by that? of course i have taste! *then i start sniffling loudly, my nose and throat making loud snorting sounds and you can see my nostrils narrowing quickly and vibrating as i inhale sharply.

She was amazed and felt happy again. She couldn&#x27;t believe it. Then she hopped up and ran back to join the game.
DNA extraction, sequencing, and data processing were performed using a previously described method.
Low NKCC is evident very early in the course of rheumatoid arthritis and is thus unlikely to be secondary to chronic inflammation.
