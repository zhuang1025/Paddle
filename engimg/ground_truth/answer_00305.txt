but you could also include a funny mug or something like that if you want to make him laugh about it.
Parasite overdispersion reduces the number of hosts who are microfilaria-positive and concentrates allele *Y* into a small proportion of the host population.
It is interesting to note the wide range of microfilarial genotype distributions that can be generated by the null model.

Is it compatible with existing equipment?
0000211-McCall1],[@pntd.0000211-Michael1]. These aspects of *W. bancrofti* transmission increase the likelihood that a host will be infected with closely related parasites and will contribute to the observed genetic differentiation.

Some may wonder why their favorite credit union does not have the same level of digital service.
Simplify (k**(-6/5)*k*k*k*k*k*k*k**(2/9)/k*k)**(-3/8) assuming k is positive.
Variations in transmission stage allele frequency and genotype distribution could be generated randomly or be a product of the parasite\&#x27;s spatial structure and life-history traits.

How do I make it automatically use the default value?
0000211-Macdonald1]), as overdispersion of parasites will result in fewer hosts with a single-sexed infection.
