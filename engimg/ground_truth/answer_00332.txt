Perlstein said Tuesday he had “no comment at this time,” while Delventhal could not be reached for comment.
The Wright\&#x27;s hierarchical *F*-statistic is used to investigate the correlation of parasite genes within and between human hosts [@pntd.
Central Connecticut State University President Zulma R. Toro announced Tuesday that she is seeking to fire two longtime theater professors after investigators concluded that each had likely engaged in sexual misconduct with one or more students.

Possible contamination of the liquid is not prevented, nor can this principle be used as a disposable part or for higher frequencies (&gt;1 Hz).
A combination of sampling transmission stages and parasite inbreeding could cause estimates of the underlying adult worm allele frequency to be highly variable, increasing the number of samples that need to be genotyped in order to detect significant changes in the adult worm genome with time after introduction of chemotherapeutic pressure.
