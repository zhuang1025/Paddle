The Ace and Chao (only presence/absence of taxa considered) indexes determine the richness in a community, while the Shannon and Simpson indexes (additionally accounts for the number of times that each taxon was observed) determine the richness and/or evenness of a community.
Sticking to a new habit isn’t easy.
Slaren: “The path to the Lost Library,” Slaren said. “A place where forbidden knowledge lies. But beware, Karen. The library guards its secrets fiercely.”
However, sampling transmission stages from as many hosts as possible should be considered the optimum strategy, even in a population with low parasite genetic differentiation between hosts, as it reduces the chance of repeatedly sampling offspring of the same adult worm.
g. available, unavailable and some more. So the resulting DOM may look like this:
He is being held by provincial police in Drummondville.
He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.

             Correlation of parasite alleles within parasite infrapopulations relative to alleles drawn at random from parasites within the same village (parasite genetic differentiation between hosts within villages)
97. Riddle: The person who makes it has no need of it; the person who buys it has no use for it.
Chris appeared fitter than James, and James was concerned if he would become a liability for Chris.

The document DE 103 37 484 B4 describes a noncontact dosing system, in which a tube is squeezed at a high speed, so that a free-flying droplet of liquid is formed.
* [@pntd.0000211-Schwab1]. The exact number of samples taken from each of the 30 hosts was: 11, 10, 15, 9, 11, 9, 13, 10, 10, 7, 10, 10, 7, 1, 11, 9, 1, 7, 4, 1, 10, 9, 8, 6, 4, 6, 9, 10, 10, 8, for a total of 246 microfilariae.
